When deciding on which license is best for a project, there are several factors to take into consideration.
First, many make the mistake of forgetting to add license. When this occurs, the software is actually under
an exclusive copyright due to US law. As such, it is imperative to use a license in your project if you'd like
for others to use your code for free.

I personally agree with the author in his explanation of Gopher's predicament.  I believe that the outcome was well
explained and articulated.

Android has an interesting history and use-case. It's an operating system that different manufactures modify and embed
in their devices.  Google is a gate-keeper when it comes to this technology especially considering they produce their
own hardware now.  While the Kernel (linux based) is licensed under GPL v2, Google decided to license Android under Apache 2.0.  
This license is more geared towards the properietary and commercial space.

Example project: Open Source LMS
License: Apache 2.0 License

Generally speaking the GPL license seems to be best for the community. It's user-friendly and requires that in dynamic libraries,
that the license still applies.

On the other hand, the LGPL license seems to be better suited for the corporate environment.  Only statically linked libraries
must use the underlying license.  The corporation can choose a different license.

Lastly is the Apache license, which is best suited for an individual developer.  This license prohibits trademarks.

This semester I'd like to write a node library for Uniden brand radio scanners over serial communication.
This package is specifically geared towards developers and will provide them a linear control-flow interface.
I plan on using the MIT license for this project.
